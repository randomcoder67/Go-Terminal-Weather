# Go-Weather 

A terminal program written entirely in Golang to view the weather forecast. Should work worldwide as the MetOffice and BBC Weather are not limited to just the UK. 

## ToDo 

* Introduce comparison row, which checks how similar/different the MetOffice and BBC Weather forecasts are
* Add legend
* Add system to trim BBC Weather down to 3 hour time slots to match MetOffice
* Option to toggle between trimmed and full BBC Weather
* Better colours
* Ability to have multiple themes
* Tidy up code
* Add screenshots
